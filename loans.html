        <p>Our picks for the best personal loans
            We analyzed dozens of personal loan lenders and selected our top picks for the best personal loans out there, sorted by what we believe makes the loan stand out.
            
            Best for home improvement: LightStream
            Why LightStream stands out: LightStream — the online lending division of Truist Bank — offers personal loans ranging from $5,000 to $100,000, making it possible for you to tackle home improvement projects from small to large.
            
            If you don’t want to (or can’t) use home equity to fund improvements, LightStream might be a good option. The lender offers very competitive interest rates and promises to beat other lenders’ rates in certain circumstances.
            
            Good credit required — Without a strong credit profile, you may have difficulty qualifying for a loan with LightStream.
            No-fee promise — LightStream doesn’t charge fees like origination or application fees or charge a prepayment penalty for early repayment of its personal loans.
            No option to prequalify — You can’t check rates and terms without affecting your credit scores. Applying for a personal loan with LightStream will generate a hard credit inquiry, which may lower your credit scores.

            Best for bad credit: NetCredit
            Why NetCredit stands out: NetCredit looks at factors beyond your credit scores when evaluating your loan application. Plus, NetCredit reports payments to “major credit bureaus,” which can help you build your credit history if you make all your payments on time as agreed. NetCredit also offers access to online financial education to help improve your knowledge about a range of financial topics, including budgeting, credit scores, saving and more.
            
            High interest rates — Because NetCredit works with people who have bad credit, the interest rates the company offers are higher than what you may find from other lenders. But NetCredit’s rates are lower than what payday lenders typically charge.
            Fees — NetCredit charges late fees in some states. But there are no fees for paying off your loan early, which can save you on interest charges, or for insufficient funds.
            Ability to prequalify — If you’re eligible to receive a loan from NetCredit, you’ll receive an offer with estimated rates and loan terms. NetCredit uses a soft credit inquiry, which doesn’t affect your credit scores, to make you a prequalification offer. If you accept the offer, a hard inquiry will be generated. A hard inquiry may negatively affect your credit scores for a short time.

            Best for building credit: Upstart
            Why Upstart stands out: Upstart is a lending marketplace that says it considers nontraditional factors, such as education and job history, when making loan decisions. If you’re trying to improve your credit scores, Upstart may be an option, as the lender considers applicants with lower credit scores.
            
            Upstart offers personal loans ranging from $1,000 to $50,000 and repayment terms of three or five years.
            
            Range of interest rates — Upstart’s interest rates range from competitive to relatively high. The lender’s rates are determined by factors such as an applicant’s credit, annual income, education and job history.
            Prequalification available — When you apply for prequalification, Upstart uses a soft credit inquiry, which doesn’t affect your credit scores, to provide estimated loan amounts and terms you might qualify for. But prequalification doesn’t guarantee approval. And if you are approved, your loan amount and terms might be different than what you saw when you applied for prequalification.
            Potentially fast funding — If your loan application is approved and you accept your loan terms by 5 p.m. Eastern time, Upstart says you’ll typically receive your loan funds by the next business day. When you can actually access those funds will depend on your bank.

            Best credit union for personal loans: Alliant Credit Union
            Why Alliant stands out: You must be a member to apply for a loan from Alliant Credit Union, but it’s not difficult to join. If you’re a member or decide to become one, Alliant Credit Union offers competitive rates, debt protection plans and sometimes even same-day loan funding.
            
            Competitive interest rates — Alliant Credit Union offers competitive interest rates on its personal loans, which vary based on the loan term. Loans with shorter repayment periods have lower interest rates than loans with longer repayment terms.
            Debt protection plan — With Alliant Credit Union’s debt protection plan, your monthly payments may be suspended or canceled due to disability, involuntary unemployment or death — without additional interest, penalties or impact to your credit scores.
            Loan amounts — Alliant Credit Union offers personal loans in amounts ranging from $1,000 to $100,000 with repayment terms of 12 to 60 months.
